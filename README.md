# ToDo List App

A new Flutter project to help you with your daily tasks. This app allows users to add tasks that they need to accomplish and once they completed the task, the user can slide the task tile to add the task to the completed task list. The personal data provided by the user is stored in a json file in the device. The user can also delete the task by sliding the task tile towards right. The application is incorporated with an animation to make it look more interactive.
